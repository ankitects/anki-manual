## Style Guidelines

In 2024, we began efforts to standardize the styles used throughout the documentation. You will probably find that following conventions are not consistently applied in the manual, but these are the rules we are using going forward. If you are submitting edits or updates, please follow these guidelines, and you are welcome to update other text to fit these guidelines as well. 

- Use double quotes, `"`, instead of single quotes, `'`.
- For emphasis, such as when defining a word, use italics, `_`.
- Also use italics when referring to a word itself rather than what it means, e.g. "To search for either _dog_ or _cat_, use `dog or cat`".
- When referring to UI elements, use bold formatting, `**`.
- When referring to keyboard buttons, wrap them with `<kbd></kbd>`.
- Use code formatting for example inputs by wrapping them with backticks, `` ` ``.

## Preserving Legacy Links

### Removing a section

We often use anchor links to direct users to the specific section of a page that will be most useful to them. These anchor links are created from section headers, e.g., `https://docs.ankiweb.net/deck-options.html#timers`. 

If you are submitting a PR that changes or deletes a section header, add a hidden anchor so those legacy anchor links will continue to function correctly. 

Example: To change the header "Clocks" to "Timers" -- replace: 
```
## Clocks
```
with:
```
## Timers
<a id="Clocks"></a>
```

### Removing a page

If you are submitting a PR that results in a page being removed from the manual or FAQ entirely:  

1. Remove that "chapter" from the [SUMMARY](src/SUMMARY.md) in the manual [or FAQ: [SUMMARY](../../../faqs/blob/main/src/SUMMARY.md)].

2. Consider whether the link should be redirected to a new location for that documentation, or fail with a [404 error](https://docs.ankiweb.net/404.html). If it should be redirected, add an entry to the `[output.html.redirect]` section of [book.toml](book.toml) in the manual [or FAQ: [book.toml](../../../faqs/blob/main/book.toml)]. 
   * Example: `"old-page-name.html" = "new-page-name.html"`
   * See the [mdBook Documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/configuration/renderers.html#outputhtmlredirect).
