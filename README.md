## Style Guidelines

The following conventions are not consistently applied in the manual. If you find such text, feel free to change it.

- Use double quotes, `"`, instead of single quotes, `'`.
- For emphasis such as when defining a word, use italics, `_`.
- Also use italics when referring to a word itself rather than what it means, e.g. "To search for either _dog_ or _cat_, use `dog or cat`".
- When referring to UI elements, use bold formatting, `**`.
- When referring to keyboard buttons, wrap them with `<kbd></kbd>`.
- Use code formatting for example inputs by wrapping them with backticks, `` ` ``.
