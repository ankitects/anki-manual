## Menu Shortcuts

On Windows/Linux you can hold down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and press a highlighted
letter to activate a particular menu.

Although macOS doesn’t support this feature, it does allow you instead to assign
shortcuts to specific menu items. Please see

## Debug Console

Sometimes you may be asked to use the debug console to change a setting
or check something. Unless asked to enter text in the "debug console",
you will probably not need this. Advanced users may like to read more
about it in the [add-on writing guide](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net/debugging.html#debug-console).

When asked to enter text into the "debug console", please start Anki,
and in the main window, press

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>

(the control key, shift key, and semi-colon key at the same time)

On a Mac, press

<kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd>

(the command key, shift key, and semi-colon key at the same time)

On some non-English keyboards, you may need to press <kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>+</kbd> instead
of <kbd>;</kbd>.

In the window that has popped up, please paste the text you were asked
to paste in the top section. When you’ve done so, please press
Ctrl+Return (Command+Return on a Mac), and some text should appear in
the bottom section. If you’ve been asked to paste the resulting output,
please copy it from the bottom area, and paste it back to the support
person.

If you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> instead of just <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>, Anki will
try to print the result rather than doing what you asked it to. If you
are getting unexpected errors, please make sure you’re not holding down
the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key.
