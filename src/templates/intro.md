# Card Templates

Card templates tell Anki which fields should appear on the front and back of your card,
and control which cards will be generated when certain fields have text in them.
By adjusting your card templates, you can alter the design and styling of many of your
cards at once.

Card templates are covered in some of the intro videos:

## The Templates Screen

You can modify card templates by clicking the "Cards..." button inside the
editing screen.

For older Anki versions, on the top left is the front template, on the bottom left is the back
template, and in between them is the card styling section. For Anki versions
2.1.28+ the front, back, and styling are no longer shown at the same time.
You can switch between them with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>, and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>.

In Anki, templates are written in HTML, which is the language that web
pages are written in. The styling section is CSS, which is the language
used for styling web pages.

On the right is a preview of the front and back of the currently
selected card. If you opened the window while adding notes, the preview
will be based on the text you had typed into the Add Notes window. If
you opened the window while editing a note, the preview will be based on
the content of that note. If you opened the window from Tools → Manage
Note Types, Anki will display each field’s name in parentheses in place
of content.

At the top right of the window is an Options button that gives you
options to rename or reorder the cards, as well as the following two
options:

- The 'Deck Override' option allows you to change the deck that cards
  generated from the current card type will be placed into. By
  default, cards are placed into the deck you provide in the Add Notes
  window. If you set a deck here, that card type will be placed into
  the deck you specified, instead of the deck listed in the Add Notes
  window. This can be useful if you want to separate cards into
  different decks (for instance, when studying a language, to put
  production cards in one deck and recognition cards in another). You
  can check which deck the cards are currently going to by choosing
  Deck Override again.

- The 'Browser Appearance' option allows you to set different (perhaps
  simplified) templates for display in the Question and Answer columns
  of the browser; see [browser appearance](styling.md#browser-appearance) for more
  information.
