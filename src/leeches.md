# Leeches

<!-- toc -->

Leeches are cards that you keep forgetting. Because they require so
many reviews, they take up a lot more of your time, compared to other cards.

Anki can help you identify leeches. Each time a review card 'lapses' (is 
failed while it is in review mode), a counter increases. When this counter
reaches 8, Anki tags the note as a leech and suspends the card. The 
threshold, and whether to suspend or not, can be adjusted in the
[deck options](deck-options.md).

If you keep failing that card, Anki will continue to alert you about the 
leech periodically. These warnings occur at half the initial leech 
threshold. For example, if you set the warning at 8 lapses, future 
warnings will happen every 4 lapses (at 12, 16, and so on).

Once a leech is found, there are several ways to handle it.

## Editing

The most efficient method to deal with leeches is to change how the
information is presented. Maybe your cards have too much information, or 
you’re trying to memorize something without fully understanding it. Often, 
it helps to follow the [20 rules of formulating 
knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation),
proposed by Dr Piotr Wozniak, the creator of SuperMemo. Some cards can 
benefit from a mnemonic. Even some well-written cards may need a boost in 
coherence, e.g. by adding cards for related concepts. However, it takes a 
lot of experience to know how to formulate the material properly, break it 
down into smallest possible components, and use mnemonic techniques.

## Deleting

If the material you’re struggling with isn't important enough to justify 
the time spent, you can simply delete the card. By selectively deleting
difficult and obscure items, you can spend more time learning other 
material, making studying more enjoyable. If you think the card might be 
useful for future reference, you can leave it suspended.

## Waiting

Some leeches are caused by 'interference'. For example, an English
learner may have recently learnt the words "disappoint" and "disappear".
As they look similar, the learner may find themselves confusing the two
when trying to answer. In such situations, it’s often helpful to
concentrate on one idea at a time. Once that idea is firmly ingrained in 
your mind, you can then start learning the other idea. So, in these
situations, you might want to leave one of the words suspended until you
have learnt the other one well, and then unsuspend it.
