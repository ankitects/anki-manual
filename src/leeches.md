# Leeches

<!-- toc -->

Leeches are cards that you keep forgetting. Because they require so
many reviews, they take up a lot more of your time than other cards.

Anki can help you identify leeches. Each time a review card 'lapses' (is 
failed while it is in review mode), a counter is increased. When that
counter reaches 8, the note is tagged as a leech, and the card is
suspended. The threshold, and whether to suspend or not, can be adjusted
in the [deck options](deck-options.md).

If you continue to review that card, Anki will keep issuing leech warnings
periodically. The warning interval is half the initial leech threshold.
That is, if you have Anki configured to warn at 8 lapses, future warnings
will happen every 4 lapses. (12, 16, etc.)

Once a leech is found, there are several ways to handle it.

## Editing

The most efficient method to deal with leeches is to change the way the
information is presented. Perhaps your cards have too much information on
them, or perhaps you’re trying to memorize something without fully
understanding it. Most often, you will benefit from following the [20 rules
of formulating 
knowledge](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/20_rules_of_knowledge_formulation),
which were proposed by Dr Piotr Wozniak, the creator of SuperMemo. Some 
cards can benefit from the use of a mnemonic. Even some well-written cards 
may need a boost in coherence, e.g. by adding cards for related concepts. 
However, you will need a lot of experience to figure out how to properly 
formulate the material, split it into smallest possible components and use 
mnemonic techniques.

## Deleting

If the material you’re struggling with is not important enough to make it 
worth your time, you can simply delete the card. By selectively deleting 
difficult and obscure items, you can dedicate more time to learning other 
material and studying becomes a lot more fun. If you think that the card 
may be useful for future reference, you can also leave it suspended.

## Waiting

Some leeches are caused by 'interference'. For example, an English
learner may have recently learnt the words "disappoint" and "disappear".
As they look similar, the learner may find themselves confusing the two
when trying to answer. In these situations, it’s often productive to
concentrate on just one idea. When that idea is firmly ingrained in your
mind, you can then return to learning the other idea. So in these
situations, you may want to leave one of the words suspended until you
have learnt the other one well, and then unsuspend it.
