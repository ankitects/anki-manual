# Effective Use of Anki

Anki can be used in various ways. However, to use it effectively, we recommend following the guidelines in this section. The guidelines here apply to most people using Anki regardless of the subject they are learning.

## General Advice

* **Memorise only when you understand**

Anki helps you memorise and retain information. But if you don't try to understand the information first, you'll have a hard time learning anything. Before trying to memorise anything make sure you understand it.

A good practice is to learn something first by studying external materials and then create cards in Anki for any information you need to retain for long-term.

 * **Learn basics first**

First learn the basics and only then go into the details. Learning finer details gets easier when you have the basics clear. This also applies to learning languages where you should learn the easier words first before learning more complex vocabulary.

* **Avoid interference**

Interference is when learning one thing makes remembering another harder. For example, if you learn of dates together you'll have a hard time remembering them later. 

Interference is a major cause of forgetting and therefore you should try to avoid it as much as possible. We know that maximum interference is caused when very similar materials are learned in a sequence. Avoid this. Arrange your study in such a way that you do not learn similar topics one after the other.

## Creating Good Cards

Creating effective cards primarily depends on how you write the question. A good question is short, simple and tractable. Here we detail some of the best practices for making your cards more effective.

### Make Cards Simple

The "minimum information principle" says that we should keep information included in one card to a minimum.

Here is a card that doesn't follow the minimum information principle.

```
 Q: What are the characteristics of the Amazon Rainforest?
 A: The Amazon Rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering around 5.5 million square kilometers. It spans across nine countries, with the majority in Brazil. It is home to diverse ecosystems and contains more than 400 billion trees. The rainforest produces 20% of the Earth's oxygen. The Amazon rainforest is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth."
```

To make our cards simple, we need to break them into parts so that each card has the minimum amount of information. Here is how the same information looks like when we break it down into multiple question and answer pairs:

```
 Q: What is the size of the Amazon Rainforest?
A: Around 5.5 million square kilometers.

Q: How many countries does the Amazon Rainforest span across?
A: 9 countries.

Q: Which country contains the majority of the Amazon Rainforest?
A: Brazil.

Q: How many trees are estimated to be in the Amazon Rainforest?
A: More than 400 billion.

Q: How much of the Earthâ€™s oxygen does the Amazon Rainforest produce?
A: 20 percent.

Q: What does "lungs of the Earth" refer to?
A: The Amazon rainforest.
```

Simple cards are easier to answer and they allow Anki to schedule each piece information more efficiently.

**Use Cloze Cards**

An easy way of breaking down information is cloze cards. Instead of writing our own question-answer pairs, cloze cards allow us to directly use sentences from the source. Here is an example:

```
Q: [...] is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth. 
A: The Amazon rainforest is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth.
```

In this example, we have taken a sentence and replaced one part of it with `[...]` in the question. This is much faster than creating a question by yourself.

Anki comes with a built-in cloze note type which can be used to generate such cards. For details on how to use cloze, see [link](./adding-editing.md#cloze-deletion).

**Use Images**

Images can help in making cards simpler. Even when an image has the same amount of information as text, it is easier to remember the image. For example, take the following card:

```
Q: What country's flag has red on top, green on bottom and a yellow star in the centre?
A: Burkina Faso.
```

This card includes a unnecessarily long explanation of how the flag looks like. Instead of describing the flag of Burkina Faso, we can replace the description with the picture of Burkina Faso's flag.


### Make Cards with One Answer

Cards should have one clear answer. Cards that have multiple possible answers make learning difficult. Making your cards simpler using the minimum information principle helps in this. But at times, you'll have to use other methods to ensure your cards follow this principle.

**Turn Sets into Ordered Lists**

If you're learning a set of items, you can try to create cards for each item in the set. However, if you cannot avoid learning the set of items together, turn the set into an ordered list of items.

For example, if you're learning the names of different regions in human stomach, you can list them in the order food goes through them.

```
 Q: List the regions of Stomach.
 A: Cardia, Fundus, Body, Pylorus.
```

It is also possible to list items in alphabetical order.

```
Q: List the landlocked countries of Central Asia.
A: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.
```


When answering such cards, make sure you're answering the items in the order they are in the card. If you're not following a particular order this makes memorisation harder and may create "retrieval-induced forgetting".

**Use Hints Properly**

You can sometimes add hints to your question to make it more precise. Use hints to clarify the context of the question.

If you're learning Hindi, you might encounter two words for "sky": *Akash* and *Asman*. The first word comes from Sanskrit and is more formal whereas the second word is Persian in origin and is used more casually. To clarify which one the question is asking, you can write your cards like this:

```
Q: (formal) Sky
A: Aakash
```

Here, the `(formal)` prefix makes it clear which word is the answer to this question.
