## Qt6 Video Driver

If you're experiencing display issues or crashes in Anki 23.10+, you can try
changing the video driver in the preferences screen, then restarting Anki.

Older Anki versions did not provide an option in the preferences, but allowed
you to adjust the driver by opening Terminal.app, then pasting the following and hit enter:

```
echo software > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Anki2/gldriver6
```

It will not print anything. You can then start Anki again.

If you wish to switch back to the default, change `software` to `auto`, or
remove that file.

## eGPUs

If you experience blank screens when using an external graphics card on a Mac, you can ctrl+click on the Anki app, click "Get Info", and enable the "prefer eGPU" option.
