# Platform Notes

This section explains the way Anki is installed, and the possible problems you may encounter, depending on your OS:

- [Windows](./windows/intro.md)
- [macOS](./mac/intro.md)
- [Linux](./linux/intro.md)

If you have already installed Anki, you can skip to the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) section.

Anki and AnkiMobile use calendar versioning (CalVer), specifically, the following format: year.month.patch. For example, let's break down Anki 25.02.7. "25" means that this version of Anki was released in 2025. "02" means it was released in February. "7" means that this is the seventh minor update. If the year and/or the month numbers change, that means it's a major change.
