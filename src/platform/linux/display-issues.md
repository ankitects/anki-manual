## Display Issues on Linux

Hardware acceleration defaults to on. If you experience blank screens
or display issues, you can try enabling software rendering.

### Changing the Driver From the Preferences Screen
In Anki 23.10+, you can change the graphics driver from preferences screen by
navigating to **Tools â†’ Preferences** and then selecting the driver from the
dropdown menu.

### Changing the Driver From the Terminal
```
echo software > ~/.local/share/Anki2/gldriver6
```

If you wish to switch back to the default, change `software` to `auto`, or
remove that file.
