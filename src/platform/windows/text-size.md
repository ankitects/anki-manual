# Text Size

If you find the text is the wrong size, there are two environmental
variables you can try:

- ANKI_NOHIGHDPI=1 will turn off some of Qt’s high dpi support

- ANKI_WEBSCALE=1 will alter the scale of Anki’s web views (like the
  deck list, study screen, etc), while leaving interface elements like
  the menu bar alone. Replace 1 with the desired scale, such as 1.5 or
  0.75.

On Windows you can add these to a batch file to make it easier to start
Anki. For example, create a file called startanki.bat on your desktop
with the following text:

    set ANKI_WEBSCALE=0.75
    start "Anki" "C:\Program Files\Anki\anki"

After saving, you can double click on the file to start Anki with that
setting.
