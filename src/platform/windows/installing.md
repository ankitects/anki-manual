# Installing & Upgrading Anki on Windows

<!-- toc -->

## Requirements

Recent Anki releases require a computer running the 64 bit version of Windows
7, 8, 10 or 11.

The last Anki release that supported 32 bit Windows was Anki 2.1.35-alternate.
If you're on an old machine, you can obtain the old release from the [releases
page](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases).

## Installing

To install Anki:

1. Download Anki from <https://apps.ankiweb.net>
2. Save the installer to your desktop or downloads folder.
3. Double-click on the installer to run it. If you see an error
message, please see the links on the left.
4. Once Anki is installed, double-click on the new star icon on your
desktop to start Anki.

## Upgrading

If upgrading from Anki 2.1.6+, there is no need to uninstall the previous
version first. All you need to do is close Anki if it is open, and then follow
the installation steps above. Your cards will be preserved when you upgrade.

If upgrading from an Anki version before 2.1.6, or switching from the standard
to the alternate version or vice versa, we recommend uninstalling the old
version first, which will remove Anki's program data, but not delete your card
data.

If you wish to downgrade to a previous version, please make sure you
[downgrade first](http://changes.ankiweb.net).

## Add-on Compatibility

Some add-ons have not been updated to support the latest Anki release yet. If an
add-on you depend on has not been ported to the latest release yet, you may have
more luck with 2.1.44 from the [releases
page](https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases).

## Problems

If you encounter any issues when installing or starting Anki, please see the
