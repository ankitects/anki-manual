# Add-ons

Ankiâ€™s capabilities can be extended with add-ons. Add-ons can provide
features like extra support for specific languages, extra control over
scheduling, and so on.

To browse the list of available add-ons, select the Tools>Add-ons
menu item, then click on Get Add-ons.

Many add-on authors include their email address in the add-on, so if you
need to get in touch with the author, editing the add-on and looking at
the top of the file may help.

If you have downloaded an add-on that is not working properly, or if you
accidentally made a mistake when editing an add-on, you can use the
"Delete" option in the menu to remove it.

To learn how to write your own add-ons, please see the [add-on writing
guide](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net).
