# Add-ons

Anki's capabilities can be extended with add-ons. Add-ons can provide
features like extra support for specific languages, extra control over
scheduling, and so on.

To browse the list of available add-ons, select the Tools>Add-ons
menu item, then click on Get Add-ons.

If you have downloaded an add-on that is not working properly, or if you
accidentally made a mistake when editing an add-on, you can use the
"Delete" option in the menu to remove it.

Add-ons use and modify arbitrary parts of Ankiâ€™s codebase, so in some
cases, updating Anki can break the compatibility with older add-ons. If 
one of your add-ons stops working after updating Anki, please consider
reporting the issue to the add-on author. If you rely on this add-on,
you will need to keep using an older Anki version until the add-on gets 
an update. 

There is a "Contact Author" button on most add-ons pages on Ankiweb, 
and many authors include their email address in the add-on, so if you
need to get in touch with the author, editing the add-on and looking at
the top of the file may help.

To learn how to write your own add-ons, please see the [add-on writing
guide](https://addon-docs.ankiweb.net).
