# Syncing with AnkiWeb

<!-- toc -->

AnkiWeb is a service that allows you to keep your collection
synchronized across multiple devices, and to study online. Please sign
up for a [free account](https://ankiweb.net/) before following the steps
below.

## Intro Videos

For a quick introduction to syncing, please check out the
[syncing intro videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkiM4DPzSVc&list=PLGgmaKOIHykFoomqkBJAyGiDQ2kyiuTao&yt:cc=on).

## Setup

To start syncing your collection across devices, click the sync button
(the top right one on the [main screen](studying.md#decks), or press <kbd>Y</kbd> on your keyboard.
You’ll be prompted for your AnkiWeb ID and password, which you created
in the signup process.

When you synchronize your collection for the first time, Anki will ask
you if you want to upload or download. If you have cards on your
computer and your AnkiWeb account is empty, choose **Upload** to send your
data to AnkiWeb. If you have cards on AnkiWeb from another device, and
no cards on your computer, choose **Download** to replace the empty local
collection with the cards that are on AnkiWeb. If you have different
cards on both devices, [more work is required](#merging-conflicts) to
avoid losing data.

Once the initial one-way sync is completed, Anki will be able to merge
changes from multiple locations with a few exceptions.

If you have multiple people using Anki on one machine and have created a
profile for each user, each user will need to create their own AnkiWeb
account to sync with. If you attempt to synchronize multiple profiles
with a single AnkiWeb account, you will lose data.

## Automatic Syncing

Once syncing is enabled, Anki will automatically sync each time your
collection is closed or opened. If you would prefer to synchronize
manually, you can disable automatic syncing in Anki’s [preferences.](preferences.md#syncing)

## Button Color

The sync button will change to blue when a normal sync is required,
and red when a full sync is required.

## Media

You can watch a [related video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phP9GGG-PxY) on this topic.

Anki will synchronize any sounds and images used by your notes. It will
notice when media has been added, removed or replaced in your [media folder](files.md#user-data), but
will not notice if you have made edits to existing files. To get your edits synced, you
need to add, remove or replace a file as well.

One-way syncs (where you're prompted to upload or download) have no influence over how media
syncs - media changes are always merged.

To prevent accidental data loss, deletions will only sync to other devices if they are made after
media is fully in sync. If you delete files before your device is fully in sync, and the deleted
files are already on AnkiWeb, they will be downloaded the next time you sync.

If you have accidentally deleted media files, and want to restore them, open the preferences
and log out. The next time you sync, Anki will restore any deleted files, if they are available
on AnkiWeb still.

If you’re running Anki off a [USB flash drive](files.md#running-from-a-flash-drive), you should use an NTFS
file system, as Anki may not be able to detect media changes on a FAT32
filesystem.

## Conflicts

You can watch a [related video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEAcpfMQnjo) on this topic.

Under normal circumstances, reviews and note edits can be merged, so if
you review or edit on two different devices before syncing, Anki will
preserve your changes from both locations. If the same card has been
reviewed in two different locations, both reviews will be marked in the
revision history, and the card will be kept in the state it was when it
was most recently answered.

There are certain changes that Anki is unable to merge. These mainly
relate to the format of notes: things like adding a new field, or
removing a card template. When you perform an operation that can’t be
merged, Anki will warn you, and give you the option of aborting the
operation. If you choose to continue, you’ll be asked to choose whether
to keep the local copy or the copy on AnkiWeb when your collection is
next synchronized.

If certain problems are detected while syncing, Anki forces a

one-way sync. If you find this consistently happening, please post on our
[support site](https://forums.ankiweb.net).

When a one-way sync is required, you need to choose whether you wish to
keep the collection on your local device, or the collection on AnkiWeb.
If changes have been made on both ends, only changes on one end can be
preserved.

If you choose **Upload**, the content on your local device will be sent to
AnkiWeb. You then need to sync your other devices, and choose **Download**
to have them grab a copy of that content.

If you choose **Download**, it will replace any local changes you’ve made
with the data that is on AnkiWeb.

Once all devices are in sync, future syncs will return to the normal
behaviour of merging changes from both ends.

If you wish to force a full upload or download (for example, because you
accidentally deleted a deck on one side and want to restore the deck
rather than having its deletion synchronized), you can check the "On
next sync, force changes in one direction" box in
**Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Network**, then sync as usual. (You’ll be given
the option to choose which side you want to use.)

Forcing a one way sync only affects card syncing - media is synced as
normal. If you have files that you want to remove from AnkiWeb, please
ensure your client is fully in sync first. After syncing is up to date,
any files you remove (e.g. via the **Check Media** function) will be removed
from AnkiWeb on the following sync.

## Merging Conflicts

Because the [first sync](#setup) can only sync changes in one
direction, if you have added different content to different devices or
profiles before setting syncing up, content on one device will be lost
if you overwrite it with the content from the other device. With some
work, it is possible to manually merge data into a single collection.

Start by taking a backup on each device/profile, in case something goes
wrong. With the computer version you can use **File &gt; Export** to export
"all decks" with scheduling information and media files included, and
save the file somewhere safe. In AnkiMobile, the Add/Export button on
the decks list screen will let you export all decks with media.

Next, if one of your devices is a mobile device, synchronize it first.
If there’s a conflict, choose **Upload** to overwrite any existing data on
AnkiWeb with the data from your mobile device. If both devices/profiles
are on your computer, synchronize the device/profile with the most
number of decks first.

Now return to the other device/profile. If automatic syncing is enabled,
a message may pop up asking if you want to upload or download. Click the
cancel button - we don’t want to sync yet.

Once you’re looking at the deck list, click the cog icon next to the
first deck, and choose **Export**. Export the content with scheduling
information and media included, and save the `.apkg` file somewhere. Now
you’ll need to repeat this for each top-level deck.

Once all top-level decks have been exported, click the sync button at
the top right, and choose **Download**, which will overwrite the local
content with the content you synced from your other device.

You can now use **File &gt; Import** to import the `.apkg` files you exported
earlier, which will merge the exported content with the existing
content, so everything will be in one place.

## AnkiWeb Data Deletion

As AnkiWeb is a free service, we need to periodically delete unused account data
to keep costs down. If you haven't accessed your account or synced in the last 6 months,
the data on your account might get deleted.

### What Gets Deleted

Only your data stored on AnkiWeb is deleted. Your account itself will remain and can be used again.

Any cards you have stored on your computer, phone or tablet will remain on those devices. Items shared from your account, including decks and add-ons will also remain on AnkiWeb.

### Returning to AnkiWeb

Once your deck data has expired, it is not possible for us to recover your data from AnkiWeb,
but you may be able to recover it if you have a local copy or a [backup](./backups.md).

### Avoiding Data Deletion

Each time you visit ankiweb.net, or use the synchronization feature in Anki, AnkiMobile or AnkiDroid,
your account will automatically be marked as active.

If your account has been inactive for 6 months or more, and you used the service for a week or longer,
we will send you an email notifying you that deletion is pending.
If you'd like to keep your account active, please log in to ankiweb.net
and study a card, or sync one of your devices within 30 days.

## Firewalls

Anki needs to be able to make outbound HTTPS connections to sync. It must be
able to connect to ankiweb.net, sync.ankiweb.net, sync2.ankiweb.net, and so on.
These domains may change over time, and the IP addresses they point to may also
change, so we recommend you allow wildcard access to \*.ankiweb.net to reduce
the chance of the firewall rules needing to be updated in the future.

If you have a firewall on your machine, you should add an exception for
Anki. If you are on a work or school network, please contact your
network administrator for assistance - it is not something we can help
you with.

## Proxies

If you need a proxy to access the internet, Anki should automatically
pick up your system proxy settings if you’re on Windows or macOS, and
will honour the HTTP_PROXY environment variable if you’re on another
platform.

Anki will only be able to pick up your system settings if a proxy is
manually configured, and does not require a password. If your system
uses automatic proxy setup, or uses a proxy that requires a username and
password, you will need to manually tell Anki the proxy configuration.

To tell Anki your proxy settings, define a HTTPS_PROXY environment
variable that points to the proxy server. It will look like:

    http://user:pass@proxy.company.com:8080

If your username or password contains an @ (e.g `user@workdomain.com`),
you need to change it to %40, like so:

    http://user%40workdomain.com:pass@proxy.company.com:8080

Anki 2.0 expects to find HTTP_PROXY instead of HTTPS_PROXY.

To set environment variables on Windows, please see
<https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+set+environmental+variable>

If you’re on a Mac, please see
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x>

Heavily locked down networks that intercept secure connections and
present their own certificates may cause Anki to throw up SSL
errors. In such environments, you may be able to work around the errors using [this add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1332261690).

An alternative solution is to install a local proxy server, and point
that proxy server at your normal proxy server. You can then tell Anki to
use the local proxy, which will redirect requests to the proxy you
normally use.
