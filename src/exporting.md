# Exporting

<!-- toc -->

Exporting allows you to save part of your collection as a text file or
packaged Anki deck. To export, click the File menu and choose **Export**.

## Text Files

If you choose "Notes in Plain Text", Anki will write the contents of the
notes into a text file. Each field is separated by a tab. If you edit
the resulting file and don't modify the first field, you can later
import that file back into Anki and Anki will update your notes based on
your edits, provided you import back into the same note type.

If you find yourself needing to edit the first field as well, you'll
need to change the format of your note type so that the first field is
an ID number rather than actual text. (You can install
the [Add note id](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/8897764)
add-on to make this easier.)

In order for formatting to be preserved when you import text back in,
the text is exported with all the HTML formatting embedded in it.

## Packaged Decks

A "packaged deck" consists of cards, notes, note types, and any sounds or
images bundled up into a file ending with .apkg or .colpkg. You can use
packaged decks to transfer cards between people, or for backing up parts
of your collection.

There are two different kinds of packaged decks.

### Collection (.colpkg)

`.colpkg` stands for "Anki Collection Package". Exporting it will export your
entire collection. The collection contains all decks with scheduling included.
You can use the collection package to back up your collection, or copy it to
another device.

```admonish info
Collection packages created with previous versions of Anki were called
`collection.apkg`.
```

#### What Happens on Import?

If you import a `.colpkg` file, then all of your current cards in Anki will be
deleted and replaced by the cards from the `.colpkg` file. This is useful for
copying your collection back and forth between devices.

Existing media in your collection is not deleted when you import a
collection package. To delete unused media, use **Tools > Check Media**.

#### Export Options

##### Include Media
If true, local media will be included.
If false, the `.apkg` will not contain any audio, images or other media.

##### Support older Anki versions (slower/larger files)
If true, a legacy version of the file is created. Turn this on if you need to
support older clients.
If false, a modern version of the file is created. Imports and exports will be
faster, and media files will be compressed, but the resulting file will not be
readable by older Anki clients

### Deck (.apkg)

`.apkg` stands for "Anki Deck Package". You can use it to export a single deck
(and any child decks it may have).

```admonish note
If the filename is `collection.apkg`, then it is a collection package instead.
All other filenames ending with `.apkg` are deck packages.
```

#### What Happens on Import?

When you import a deck package, Anki will add the contents into your collection,
rather than overwriting your collection.

If some notes in the deck package have previously been imported, Anki
will keep the version with the most recent modification time.

```admonish example
You have a deck with the name _Biology_ and use it in Anki. You now download an
updated version of that same deck. If you import the updated deck, then Anki
will incorporate all the edits into your own Anki collection.

If you re-import an unchanged `.apkg` after making changes in your own
collection (e.g. editing cards), then Anki will keep the changes in your
collection instead of overwriting them.
```

#### Export Options

##### Include Scheduling Information
If true, scheduling information such as your review history will be exported.
If false, Anki will assume that you are sharing the deck with other people, and
will remove the entire scheduling information, including marked and leech tags.
That way users will have a clean copy of your deck.

##### Include Deck Presets
If true, deck presets will be included.

##### Include Media
If true, local media will be included.
If false, the `.apkg` will not contain any audio, images or other media.

##### Support older Anki versions (slower/larger files)
If true, a legacy version of the file is created. Turn this on if you need to
support older clients.
If false, a modern version of the file is created. Imports and exports will be
faster, and media files will be compressed, but the resulting file will not be
readable by older Anki clients
